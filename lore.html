                    <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">distant past</h2>
				<p> The Chernarussian peninsula retained relative autonomy until the Mongol Conquest of 1238, during which the region came under the control of the Golden Horde. Much of the country was once part of the Takistani Khanate, formerly an Ottoman vassal state annexed by the Russian Empire in 1784. What would one day be South Zagoria, however, was considered to be part of Circassia and would remain contested for the duration of the long and bloody Russo-Circassian war, from 1763 until 1864. The population of future South Zagoria was no exception during the Circassian Genocide that followed annexation by the Russian Empire, most of the native population being slaughtered and most of the survivors driven into diaspora. A portion of the Circassian diaspora became the traveler population known as the tulákský, keeping on the move and hiding their identities from authority to avoid persecution. They would migrate through rural areas on the outskirts of settlements, preserving their culture and ancestral paganism in secret.</p>
				<br />
				
				 <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">soviet era</h2>
				 <p>Chernarus as a whole would remain part of the Russian Empire until the rise of the Soviet Union, with Bolshevism gaining a significant foothold in South Zagoria directly before the Russian Revolution. The formerly Circassian portion of the Chernarussian Peninsula became the South Zagorian oblast, while a portion of what had once been the Takistani Khanate would come to make up the rest of the Chernarussian Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>

<p>In 1990, the first outbreaks of the infection that would one day bring civilization to its knees occurred on the rural island of Lyutyi, largely affecting the significant tulákský population that often called it home. The outbreaks were small and contained, and went largely ignored by authorities due to occurring in the marginalized and poorly documented traveler population. The resulting killings were attributed to individual acts of violence and seldom investigated further.</p>
<br />
				  <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">republic of chernarus</h2>
				  <p>With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the CSSR became the Republic of Chernarus in 1991. Outbreaks remained small, but began to pop up throughout the country. An incident in Novigrad in 1995 caught the attention of Russian Federation authorities and they quietly launched an investigation. Soon after an infected individual was found and examined a few months later, the Russian Federation deployed a limited ‘peace-keeping force’ to contain the spreading violence in the small nation. They immediately began taking steps toward the annexation of Chernarus, hoping to take hold of the situation before anyone learned about the virus. The Russians focused chiefly on the migratory tulákský population, determined to track their movements and test them.</p>
<p>While many in Chernarus grew increasingly concerned about the Russian military forces in their country, a sizable portion of the Northern population in South Zagoria was increasingly supportive of annexation. The Chernarussian Movement of the Red Star, a fringe political group pushing a return to a Soviet-style government, began to gain popularity in 1996 when they took up the cause of Russian annexation. Already associated with street violence and politically motivated assaults (particularly on the tulákský and other groups seen as preserving a distinct Chernarussian identity), their activities only increased in the region.</p>

<p>In 1997, integral Chedaki cells began receiving arms, funding, and training from the Russian government. While most were tasked with promoting Russian annexation, others were ordered to round up tulákský ‘criminals’ and imprison them, often under false pretenses or due to lack of identification. The persecution of the tulákský was a major factor in the rise of the National Party (NAPA) and their increased activities in the country. Armed clashes between NAPA members and Chedaki became more frequent over the next two years as tensions heightened.</p>
<br />				

				<h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">chernarussian civil war</h2>
				   <p>In 1999, NAPA insurgents began openly attacking Russian forces as well as prominent Chedaki. The CDF initially assisted the Russians in tracking down NAPA, trying to root them out of the country. The Russian Federation responded by increasing its own presence, though Chernarussian officials would protest the measure and appeal to the international community.</p>

<p>The Chernarussian election of the spring of 2000 resulted in a significant shift in power, allowing the Chedaki to seize control of the government. Russian annexation was passed soon after and Chernarus joined the Russian Federation. Droves of former CDF would defect to NAPA to engage in guerilla warfare against the Russian occupation rather than be absorbed into the Russian Armed Forces with the rest. Martial law was put into effect in Chernarus within days.</p>

<p>In late October of 2001, NAPA insurgents received several canisters of a weaponized aerosol containing the virus from a tulákský scientist formerly with biopreparat. Transporting the containers to Moscow, NAPA released all of them simultaneously within the city’s subway systems on October 15th, spreading the aerosol throughout the city and infecting hundreds of thousands. Over the course of the next week, the virus incubated and, though at different rates, people began to turn. Waves of small outbreaks built upon one another and soon the city erupted into chaos. Martial law was instituted, riots became common, and outbreaks went increasingly unchecked as the virus snowballed its way through the city.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world, travelers who contracted the virus in Moscow would begin to spread it themselves, with many demonstrating advanced symptoms. Small outbreaks spread throughout the world as health officials warned of a looming pandemic, but nothing had yet been seen on the scale of Moscow. International travel already having been limited following the terrorist attacks of the early fall, the outbreaks led to a near complete halt. Across the world, nations began closing their borders and focusing resources on security and medical research.</p>

<p>As the extent of the damage became clear, and with the Russian Federation under significant international pressure, the RAF established a quarantine around Moscow and began an assault on the capital. Orders were to shoot everything that didn’t immediately identify itself as human on sight. The assault took weeks and millions were slaughtered, infected and uninfected alike. By the end of the Moscow Outbreak, a city of ten million had been reduced to a mere five hundred thousand survivors. After being screened for symptoms of the infection, most surviving immigrants who’d been living in Moscow return to their home countries, or move elsewhere in the world, as do many native Russians. Many moved to more rural locations, having lost their taste for the crowded cities. Nearly all were asymptomatic carriers.</p>

<p>While the Chernarussian civil war continued for a time, resources became stretched thin and RAF increasingly had their hands full elsewhere. Both NAPA and Chedaki forces found themselves fighting infected in greater numbers as well as one another. While the war was never officially concluded, the resources to carry it out had evaporated by 2002, leaving Chernarus devoid of anything resembling cohesive authority.</p>
<br />				

				<h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">collapse of civilization</h2>
						<p>Through the early 2000s, the next waves of the infection began to occur in small pockets throughout the world, becoming more frequent and wide-spread each time. Governments, health organizations, and corporate interests scrambled to find a cure, while witch hunts began the world over as populations attempted to purge themselves of asymptomatic carriers. Safe-havens from the infection became fewer and fewer each year, until most of the world was overrun. What little infrastructure still remained hung on by only a thread. The world carried on as well as it was able, but it was clear that the situation wasn’t going to get better any time soon.</p>

<p>By 2005 the frequency and size of outbreaks became significant enough that civilization broke down. Supply lines world-wide collapsed utterly. A few self-sufficient walled settlements would manage to carry on in isolation, but international trade and communication shut down entirely and news became a thing of the past.</p>

<p>By 2010 the infection had spread to the vast majority of the world’s population. Those who survived largely did so by avoiding strangers who might have been asymptomatic carriers, though some scattered pockets of civilization persisted. The last remnants of large scale military powers had completely dissolved, leaving nothing but small scattered militias with no infrastructure or resources to speak of and wildly conflicting goals. Most of the resources the militias did gather and nearly all of their time was spent fighting one another.</p>

<p>Adapting to what the world had become, people began to find new ways of life. The 2010s and 2020s were marked by wide-spread shifting adaptation strategies as resources became more scarce. Nomadic scavenging, raiding, and migratory travel became common as the surviving population struggled to find the resources necessary to survive. The ethics and morality of the old world would seem largely impractical and sentimental to those faced with the new world’s troubles. Taboos against murder, maurauding, and slavery came to be regarded by many as quaint and unrealistic, luxuries of a bygone era that would likely never come again. Still, others would cling to the world that had been lost and do their best to preserve what they could.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the 2030s, rumors began to circulate through Europe about strange changes to some of the infected. Stories spread of inhuman creatures lurking in the wilderness, things that made the infected look ordinary. Some even spoke of a cure to the infection, and of a people who traveled freely through the horde-infested landscape. All of these whispers seemed to carry with them the name of a place bordering the waters of the Green Sea, known as Chernarus.</p>
