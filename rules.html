                    <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">general</h2>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.0</span> Treat your fellow community members with respect. Harassment, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other discriminatory behavior will not be tolerated. We will not be tracking who is and isn’t your friend; do not use this as an excuse.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.1</span> Do not spam or advertise other communities while using our server.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.2</span> Do not impersonate staff or other community members. If you are caught intentionally doing so you will be permanently banned from the server.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.3</span> Keep NSFW content in the NSFW section of the discord. No illegal content whatsoever should be posted on the server.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.4</span> Continuous trolling or flaming of other community members will be met with a ban from our server.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.5</span> We are an 18+ roleplaying server. Anyone found underage will be banned at the discretion of the admin team until otherwise proven. Additionally, characters played on the server must be at least 18 years of age.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">1.6</span> The community management team reserves the right to remove disruptive or toxic users from Decay’s servers at their discretion.</p>
                    <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">Rroleplay</h2>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.0</span> Remain in-character at all times while on the server, both over voice and text. Spamming abusive or trolly sounds, soundboards, or music over VOIP is not permitted and may result in a permanent ban.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.0.1</span> Limited OOC communication can be posted in side-chat, prefixed by // to indicate that it&rsquo;s OOC. This should only be used for things like asking for permissions, indicating that you have to go AFK abruptly, or asking questions related to game mechanics. None of this &ldquo;in your mind&rsquo;s eye, press you f muscle&rdquo; stuff. Type it.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.1</span> You must act realistically according to the situation at hand and value your life in all situations. No physical object should be more important than your own life, however you may weigh someone else&rsquo;s life as more important than your own. Judgement on this would be subjective, but you should not take actions that would throw your life away. Characters that die while showing No Value For Life may have that death counted as anywhere between one and three executions. Repeated demonstration of lack of value for life may result in further action.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.1.1</span> Non-complying in the face of overwhelming odds or with no possibility of success is considered displaying No Value For Life. If players are armed with roughly equivalent weapons, overwhelming odds would be considered a ratio of 3 to 1 or higher. </p>
                    
		    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.2</span> You may not intentionally avoid RP. This constitutes logging off in the middle of a scene or refusing to acknowledge the presence of another player by pretending to be AFK. If you plan to be AFK for an extended period, we recommend logging out of the server. We are not responsible for what happens to you while you&rsquo;re AFK. Additionally, players are expected to check their text chat for text-based RP as well as requests for perms or clarification on what a character sees.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.3</span> Do not center your RP around discrimination with real-world parallels. RPing overt racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of real-world discrimination will not be tolerated. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t play a character who&rsquo;s closed minded or biased, but keep the slurs and discriminatory comments out of the RP. That said, aggressively nationalistic Chernarussian xenophobia toward foreigners is absolutely permitted.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.4</span> Consider the experience of others in your RP. You may not repeatedly target the same group with hostility to the point that they are unable to carry out their RP. When raiding you should refrain from destroying more than is required to access the base or easily escape it; this includes items left on the ground to despawn and vehicles being destroyed if they can&rsquo;t be stolen.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.5</span> The usage of information you have received out of character to motivate your in character actions is considered metagaming and is prohibited while playing.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.5.1</span> All IC communication must be transmitted in-game, either through local VOIP or text chat. Third party IC communication must be double-micced. You must have a radio on your person and your hands must be free (not held up) and unrestrained to use third party comms IC.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.5.2</span> IC communication should take precedence over OOC communication while in game. Players or groups found to show a pattern of silently communicating on the server and never internally RPing with those they share comms with will be hit with bad RP.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.6</span> You may not force an action, belief, or status on another player&rsquo;s character without permission; this is considered Powergaming. If you wish to scar, maim, poison, execute, permanently kill (PK) or otherwise significantly alter a character, you must obtain permission from their player first. This includes feeding players raw meat, rotten food, gasoline, or anything else that could make their character model sick. Players may not intentionally poison food or water sources.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.7</span> Abuse of Game Mechanics is strictly prohibited and may result in a permanent ban from our servers.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.7.1</span> Loot cycling, duping, or glitching will result in an immediate ban. If an accidental dupe has occurred, please contact staff immediately to have duped items deleted.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.7.2</span> Players may not respawn until the &ldquo;You Are Dead&rdquo; message is visible on the screen. If unconscious, players must wait to wake up, be revived, or die naturally.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.8</span> New Life Rule - After an RP-related death such during a firefight or being otherwise &lsquo;killed&rsquo; with witnesses, you may not rejoin the scenario or come within 100 meters of your body without the consent of the parties involved. You may or may not recall the events that lead up to your death at your own discretion.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.9</span> Characters that have been validly executed three times in the course of RP are permanently killed upon the third execution and can no longer be played. PvP deaths are not normally counted as executions, but repeated PvP deaths against the same group may result in one or more executions being tallied against that character. Players are welcome to PK their character at any time voluntarily.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.9.1</span> Players or their groups may not execute the same character more than once in a two-week period (14 days) unless OOC permission is given or the previously executed character resumes hostilities of their own free will.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">2.9.2</span> Executions deemed invalid will not be tallied against the character. Whether action will be taken against the executing party is dependent on the situation and up to staff discretion.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">hostilities</h2>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.0</span> You may not kill people at random without initiation or gaining rights. Killing on sight without roleplay will result in a ban. This includes running people over in vehicles, setting bear traps, landmines, or other dangerous deployed items outside of your own base, setting explosive traps of any kind other than flashbangs, recklessly causing explosions while others are in range, or putting items in the road that cause vehicles to crash.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1</span> Kill rights must be obtained through valid means such as initiation or in response to hostile actions taken by other players. Having kill rights does not mean you should immediately use said kill rights, and re-initiating or further developing hostile RP is strongly recommended.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1.1</span> A player who takes a hostile action grants kill rights to other players in the vicinity at the time of said hostile action. These rights persist for one hour after the last hostile action is taken by either the party who took the initial hostile action or by players that gained rights from it.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1.2</span> Initiation, non-compliance with clear initiation, pot-shots, participation in combat, attacks with weapons, excessive beating with fists, and refusing to vacate private property are considered hostile actions.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1.3</span> Initiation must be made clearly, consisting of a specific demand with specific consequences. Pointing a gun at someone while making a demand is considered a specific consequence.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1.4</span> Demands must be reasonable and attainable and cannot include instructions that would result in powergaming or server rule violations.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1.5</span> Players must allow ample time for their demands to be met, and should be considerate of technical issues experienced by other players. However, there should be no expectation to put a hostile situation on hold for an extended period of time, and in extreme cases hostile players may use their judgment.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.1.6</span> Players may non-lethally render one another unconscious without initiation in the course of hostile roleplay. Methods allowed include tasers, rubber bullets, and fists. In the case of rubber bullets and fists, players who misjudge and accidentally kill their victim may be held responsible for an invalid kill. Attacks intended to render the victim unconscious are considered hostile actions.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.2</span> Players may not log out for at least 30 minutes after breaking line of sight with players who have kill rights on them without the explicit permission of those players. Logging out during this period of time is considered combat logging.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.3</span> Players may not force a situation where the only option another player has is to initiate on them. This is considered baiting. This includes but is not limited to body-blocking, using initiation demands to force someone to perform a hostile action without explicit permission, and excessive abusive behavior.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.4</span> During hostage situations both sides need to be actively participating in the roleplay and not focusing on outside factors or in-game objects.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.4.1</span> Captors must tend to all needs and protect their hostage from outside threats (including players, infected, and wolves). Hostages must be given food, water, and medicine if needed. When released, hostages must have a reasonable ability to survive. You must roleplay with your hostages.</p>

                    <p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">3.4.2</span> Execution rights can be gained on a hostage by the criteria listed below during the course of hostile RP. Grounds for valid execution include: Non-compliance as a hostage Demonstrating No Value for Life Obtaining OOC permission from the player A single instance of revenge for a previous execution committed personally by the player Just because you have these rights doesn&rsquo;t mean you should use them, or that they should be used immediately after being obtained.</p>
			    
                    <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">base building and raiding</h2>
		
		<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.0</span>When base building,  solo players are limited to up to 12 walls of any kind. Groups of five or more may have up to 20 walls. Roadblocks may use up to 10 walls. Walls may not clip into anything more than necessary to secure the wall. Groups or individuals may apply for an extension if they have a good RP-related reason. Extensions are up to staff discretion. Failure to follow this rule or subsequent rules below may result in NPC raiding or base deletion after multiple warnings.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.0.1</span> Player hubs and bases belonging to groups of five or more that have been established for at least two weeks may apply for a prefab. Prefabs are approved at staff discretion and are not guaranteed to be added exactly as submitted. Anything that isn’t approved will be discussed with the player. Staff may be requested to help build your prefab design, but are not obligated. If capable, it may be faster to design your own and have it approved. Prefabs should be submitted as a .dze.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.0.2</span> Deco items may be used to block windows and doors but may not be used unrealistically, 
such as a shed inside of a house, or a camo net blocking a door. Small items with large hit-boxes may not be used to prevent crawling or climbing as it is deemed unrealistic.</p> 

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.0.3</span> Players may not have more than 3 consecutive doors in their base or on outer walls, including airlocks. </p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.0.4</span> While there is no hard storage limit, excessive hoarding of storage items may result in NPC raids. This is to maintain server performance but also maintain a sense of reality in terms of economy. You will have some warning.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.1.</span> When raiding you should refrain from destroying more than is required to access the base or easily escape it; this includes items left on the ground to despawn and vehicles being destroyed if they can’t be stolen.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.1.1</span> When destroying a player built structure (such as a wall or door), you must open a raid evidence ticket in this discord. This ticket should include a screencap of the base in question with your coordinates printed on the screen. (Press J to print coordinates.) You will make a d20 roll to determine how many, if any, clues you leave behind. Failure to do so is considered powergaming. For more information, please see [RAID EVIDENCE DOCUMENT] While the number and sometimes type of clues is determined by a roll, the specifics are ultimately up to you.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.1.2</span> If your base has been raided and structures such as walls or doors have been broken, you may open a raid investigation ticket. Staff will then provide you with IC clues from the raid ticket submitted when breaking into your base. Staff will never reveal the trespasser directly.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.2.</span> Roadblocks built by players do not count as bases or hubs. Roadblocks are not subject to griefing rules and do not require Raid Evidence tickets. This includes any storage used as a part of the road block. Tearing down a roadblock does not count as a hostile action. If you want to defend your roadblock, you must initiate. </p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.3.</span> Any storage that is clipping into a wall or object or placed unrealistically is subject to deletion without warning. This includes safes and lockers jammed into a wall or placed inside of other objects, such as cardboard boxes and cement barricades.</p>

					<p><span class="color-purple font-weight-bold">4.4.</span> All bases must have a door or entry that is accessible. Removal of metal wire to make a door into a wall during hostile situations or before logging out is prohibited. </p>
