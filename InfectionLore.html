                    <p> </p>
					
<p>While the first outbreaks began in the early 90s, these were few in number, isolated mostly to Eastern Europe, small in severity, and usually misunderstood as simple acts of violence and mental illness. Many of those who survived these incidents found themselves convicted of murder. As some of these individuals were asymptomatic carriers, they would go on to infect others and spark a number of ‘prison riots’ that began to catch the attention of tabloid media and conspiracy theorists in the mid to late 90s. Still, most dismissed the claims as clear delusion and psychosis on the part of a few disturbed individuals.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the Moscow outbreak of late 2001 that the infection became known to the world. A week after an unidentified gas was released into the subway system via aerosol containers, small outbreaks began to spread throughout the city. Across the world, smaller outbreaks had begun as travelers to Moscow who’d been exposed returned home. A quarantine was established around the city and martial law taken into effect. Still, the streets of Moscow were a bloodbath. Under heavy international pressure, the Russian Federation sent the RAF to assault the capital and clear out the infected. By the end, a mere 500,000 of the city’s ten million occupants survived, nearly all of whom carry the virus without displaying symptoms.</p>

<p>International travel had already been severely limited as a result of the terrorist attacks earlier that year, and now across the world nations were closing their borders. Beyond that, the approaches of particular governments would vary wildly.Given the violent nature of the infection, much of the response was an increase in security measures, and political conflict over military spending versus medical research was extremely common. Some asserted a theological origin for the outbreak and  insisted that embracing religious ideals was the only way to end the spread of the virus. Others pointed their fingers at Russia and Chernarus, arguing for the invasion of one or both. Though the threat was dire, political disagreements went on without pause.</p>

<p>After Moscow, the outbreaks would become more frequent and wide-spread, slowly snowballing over the next decade. At first, on the grand scale of things they were still isolated to small pockets within the population. In time, though, safe-havens from the infection became fewer and fewer until the world was oveerrun, leaving what little infrastructure remained hanging on by a thread.</p>

<p>With medical research funding strained in much of the world and policies regarding the infected resulting in a relatively limited potential for long-term observation, progress was slow. The virus was identified and given the name Xeno-Sapiophagi Bacilla-1, or XSB as it was known to the general public. XSB  was known to have an incubation period of anywhere between a few days to a year, while some patients carrying the virus never showed symptoms. Though primarily transmitted as an airborne pathogen, exposure to blood was found to carry a much higher risk and a potentially faster incubation rate. Those infected through bites were found to turn much more quickly on average than those exposed via air.</p>

<p>Symptoms, once they develop, progress through three phases of increasing severity. Not all symptoms are displayed by every patient, and some may come and go, while others are permanent. In the first phase, symptoms are relatively mild and include fever, nausea, headache, soreness, and stiffness. During the intermediate phase, symptoms include photosensitivity, confusion, dizziness, fainting, vomiting, erratic mood, memory loss, swollen glands, painful coughing accompanied by blood, drooling, muscle spasms, and ruptured blood vessels. Advanced symptoms are those associated with ‘turning’, such as severe aggression, loss of motor skill, aphasia, cataracts, blackened glands, and bloody sputum. By the third phase the infected patient is lost in the violent, cannibalistic aggression that XSB is known for.</p>
 
<p>Through the 2000s, the infection came to be considered an unfortunate reality of life, but not something to grind the world to a halt over. Technology continued to advance and people went about their daily lives for years before things became so dire that supply lines broke down and civilization collapsed. Countries fell one by one, often through complacency, distraction, and in-fighting. In many corners of the world, extreme measures were taken to identify and eliminate potential asymptomatic carriers. Some societies responded with harsh austerity and authoritarian measures, while others tried to maintain a general sense of normalcy as long as possible. Many would deny the severity of the problem until it came to their own doorstep.</p>

<p>By the early 2010s, outbreaks were so wide-spread that civilization effectively broke down. Supply-lines broke down and international communication and trade became mostly a thing of the past. Some cities and regions would hold out longer than others, but those that remained were isolated and relatively few.</p>

<p>By 2015 the infection had spread to the vast majority of the world’s population. While a fraction of those who survived were lucky enough to do so in those few places where the infection may have been under control, the vast majority of surviving humanity wanders the ruins, scavenging and avoiding hordes. The last remnants of large scale military powers had completely dissolved, leaving nothing but small scattered militias with no infrastructure or resources to speak of and wildly conflicting goals. Most of the resources the militias did gather and nearly all of their time was spent fighting one another.</p>

<p>Adapting to what the world had become, people began to find new ways of life. The 2010s and 2020s were marked by wide-spread shifting adaptation strategies as resources became more scarce. Nomadic scavenging, raiding, and migratory travel became common as the surviving population struggled to find the resources necessary to survive. The ethics and morality of the old world would seem largely impractical and sentimental to those faced with the new world’s troubles. Taboos against murder, raiding, and slavery came to be regarded by many as quaint and unrealistic, luxuries of a bygone era that would likely never come again. Still, others would cling to the world that had been lost and do their best to preserve what they could.</p>

<p>Still, even in the 2030s, a small number of sizable colonies exist across the world where life carries on more or less the way it once did. Though power may be a bit spotty and long-range communication limited to radio waves, their lives are relatively comfortable for as long as their settlements stand.  To many these are a beacon of hope, while others dismiss them as false rumors or sentimental products of a bygone era and a source of weakness. Those who grow up in such sheltered places tend to find the outside world extremely inhospitable.</p>

<p>While lack of international communication or record keeping makes it hard to be exact, today most seasoned travelers tend to estimate that about 80% of the remaining human population is infected with XSB. The roaming of hordes not withstanding, eight infected for every two humans showing no sign of infection seems to be about average. Some assert that that number is closer to 100% and most surviving humans are just asymptomatic, but these are all really just guesses.</p>

				 <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">soviet era</h2>
				 <p>Chernarus as a whole would remain part of the Russian Empire until the rise of the Soviet Union, with Bolshevism gaining a significant foothold in South Zagoria directly before the Russian Revolution. The formerly Circassian portion of the Chernarussian Peninsula became the South Zagorian oblast, while a portion of what had once been the Takistani Khanate would come to make up the rest of the Chernarussian Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>

<p>In 1990, the first outbreaks of the infection that would one day bring civilization to its knees occurred on the rural island of Lyutyi, largely affecting the significant tulákský population that often called it home. The outbreaks were small and contained, and went largely ignored by authorities due to occurring in the marginalized and poorly documented traveler population. The resulting killings were attributed to individual acts of violence and seldom investigated further.</p>
<br />
				  <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">republic of chernarus</h2>
				  <p>With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the CSSR became the Republic of Chernarus in 1991. Outbreaks remained small, but began to pop up throughout the country. An incident in Novigrad in 1995 caught the attention of Russian Federation authorities and they quietly launched an investigation. Soon after an infected individual was found and examined a few months later, the Russian Federation deployed a limited ‘peace-keeping force’ to contain the spreading violence in the small nation. They immediately began taking steps toward the annexation of Chernarus, hoping to take hold of the situation before anyone learned about the virus. The Russians focused chiefly on the migratory tulákský population, determined to track their movements and test them.</p>
<p>While many in Chernarus grew increasingly concerned about the Russian military forces in their country, a sizable portion of the Northern population in South Zagoria was increasingly supportive of annexation. The Chernarussian Movement of the Red Star, a fringe political group pushing a return to a Soviet-style government, began to gain popularity in 1996 when they took up the cause of Russian annexation. Already associated with street violence and politically motivated assaults (particularly on the tulákský and other groups seen as preserving a distinct Chernarussian identity), their activities only increased in the region.</p>

<p>In 1997, integral Chedaki cells began receiving arms, funding, and training from the Russian government. While most were tasked with promoting Russian annexation, others were ordered to round up tulákský ‘criminals’ and imprison them, often under false pretenses or due to lack of identification. The persecution of the tulákský was a major factor in the rise of the National Party (NAPA) and their increased activities in the country. Armed clashes between NAPA members and Chedaki became more frequent over the next two years as tensions heightened.</p>
<br />				

				<h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">chernarussian civil war</h2>
				   <p>In 1999, NAPA insurgents began openly attacking Russian forces as well as prominent Chedaki. The CDF initially assisted the Russians in tracking down NAPA, trying to root them out of the country. The Russian Federation responded by increasing its own presence, though Chernarussian officials would protest the measure and appeal to the international community.</p>

<p>The Chernarussian election of the spring of 2000 resulted in a significant shift in power, allowing the Chedaki to seize control of the government. Russian annexation was passed soon after and Chernarus joined the Russian Federation. Droves of former CDF would defect to NAPA to engage in guerilla warfare against the Russian occupation rather than be absorbed into the Russian Armed Forces with the rest. Martial law was put into effect in Chernarus within days.</p>

<p>In late October of 2001, NAPA insurgents received several canisters of a weaponized aerosol containing the virus from a tulákský scientist formerly with biopreparat. Transporting the containers to Moscow, NAPA released all of them simultaneously within the city’s subway systems on October 15th, spreading the aerosol throughout the city and infecting hundreds of thousands. Over the course of the next week, the virus incubated and, though at different rates, people began to turn. Waves of small outbreaks built upon one another and soon the city erupted into chaos. Martial law was instituted, riots became common, and outbreaks went increasingly unchecked as the virus snowballed its way through the city.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world, travelers who contracted the virus in Moscow would begin to spread it themselves, with many demonstrating advanced symptoms. Small outbreaks spread throughout the world as health officials warned of a looming pandemic, but nothing had yet been seen on the scale of Moscow. International travel already having been limited following the terrorist attacks of the early fall, the outbreaks led to a near complete halt. Across the world, nations began closing their borders and focusing resources on security and medical research.</p>

<p>As the extent of the damage became clear, and with the Russian Federation under significant international pressure, the RAF established a quarantine around Moscow and began an assault on the capital. Orders were to shoot everything that didn’t immediately identify itself as human on sight. The assault took weeks and millions were slaughtered, infected and uninfected alike. By the end of the Moscow Outbreak, a city of ten million had been reduced to a mere five hundred thousand survivors. After being screened for symptoms of the infection, most surviving immigrants who’d been living in Moscow return to their home countries, or move elsewhere in the world, as do many native Russians. Many moved to more rural locations, having lost their taste for the crowded cities. Nearly all were asymptomatic carriers.</p>

<p>While the Chernarussian civil war continued for a time, resources became stretched thin and RAF increasingly had their hands full elsewhere. Both NAPA and Chedaki forces found themselves fighting infected in greater numbers as well as one another. While the war was never officially concluded, the resources to carry it out had evaporated by 2002, leaving Chernarus devoid of anything resembling cohesive authority.</p>
<br />				

				<h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">collapse of civilization</h2>
						<p>Through the early 2000s, the next waves of the infection began to occur in small pockets throughout the world, becoming more frequent and wide-spread each time. Governments, health organizations, and corporate interests scrambled to find a cure, while witch hunts began the world over as populations attempted to purge themselves of asymptomatic carriers. Safe-havens from the infection became fewer and fewer each year, until most of the world was overrun. What little infrastructure still remained hung on by only a thread. The world carried on as well as it was able, but it was clear that the situation wasn’t going to get better any time soon.</p>

<p>By 2005 the frequency and size of outbreaks became significant enough that civilization broke down. Supply lines world-wide collapsed utterly. A few self-sufficient walled settlements would manage to carry on in isolation, but international trade and communication shut down entirely and news became a thing of the past.</p>

<p>By 2010 the infection had spread to the vast majority of the world’s population. Those who survived largely did so by avoiding strangers who might have been asymptomatic carriers, though some scattered pockets of civilization persisted. The last remnants of large scale military powers had completely dissolved, leaving nothing but small scattered militias with no infrastructure or resources to speak of and wildly conflicting goals. Most of the resources the militias did gather and nearly all of their time was spent fighting one another.</p>

<p>Adapting to what the world had become, people began to find new ways of life. The 2010s and 2020s were marked by wide-spread shifting adaptation strategies as resources became more scarce. Nomadic scavenging, raiding, and migratory travel became common as the surviving population struggled to find the resources necessary to survive. The ethics and morality of the old world would seem largely impractical and sentimental to those faced with the new world’s troubles. Taboos against murder, maurauding, and slavery came to be regarded by many as quaint and unrealistic, luxuries of a bygone era that would likely never come again. Still, others would cling to the world that had been lost and do their best to preserve what they could.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the 2030s, rumors began to circulate through Europe about strange changes to some of the infected. Stories spread of inhuman creatures lurking in the wilderness, things that made the infected look ordinary. Some even spoke of a cure to the infection, and of a people who traveled freely through the horde-infested landscape. All of these whispers seemed to carry with them the name of a place bordering the waters of the Green Sea, known as Chernarus.</p>
